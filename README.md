- **Precision**: Precision is the ratio of correctly predicted positive observations to the total predicted positives.
  - For healthy loans (0), the precision is **1.00**, which means that when the model predicts an instance as class 0, it is correct 100% of the time.
  - For risky loans (1), the precision is **0.85**, indicating that when the model predicts an instance as class 1, it is correct 85% of the time.

- **Recall**: Recall is the ratio of correctly predicted positive observations to the all observations in actual class.
  - For class 0, the recall is **0.99**, indicating that 99% of actual class 0 instances were predicted correctly by the model.
  - For class 1, the recall is **0.91**, meaning that 91% of actual class 1 instances were predicted correctly by the model.

- **F1-score**: The F1-score is the harmonic mean of precision and recall. It provides a balance between precision and recall.
  - For class 0, the F1-score is **1.00**, which is the harmonic mean of precision and recall for class 0.
  - For class 1, the F1-score is **0.88**, the harmonic mean of precision and recall for class 1.

- **Support**: Support is the number of actual occurrences of the class in the specified dataset.
  - Class 0 has a support of **18765**, meaning there are 18765 instances of class 0 in the dataset.
  - Class 1 has a support of **619**, indicating there are 619 instances of class 1 in the dataset.

- **Accuracy**: Accuracy is the ratio of correctly predicted observations to the total observations. In the report, the overall accuracy of the model is **0.99** or 99%.

- **Macro Average**: The macro average calculates the metric independently for each class and then takes the average. In your report, the macro average precision, recall, and F1-score are shown.

- **Weighted Average**: The weighted average calculates the metric with respect to the number of occurrences of each class. It is useful when there is class imbalance. In your report, the weighted average precision, recall, and F1-score are provided.

Overall, this classification report indicates that the model performs very well with high precision, recall, F1-scores, and accuracy. Class 0 has better performance metrics compared to class 1, which might indicate an imbalance in the dataset or the difficulty of predicting class 1 accurately.
When it comes to a real world application it really depends on the business itself. Are they comfortable with a model that may mislabel someone as a risky loan?
The ethics of this can be interesting as someone who is actually a healthy loan classifier could be denied a loan. Someone could potentially be a perfect candidate.
The model needs to be improved in that aspect, but in regards for everything else, an accuracy opf 99% is really high and can work really well.
